# Todo-List

The project involves developing a todo list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are the key features and aspects covered:

1. **HTML Structure**: Uses semantic HTML to structure the todo list and its components, including input fields, buttons, and list items (`<li>`).

2. **Styling with CSS**: Applies custom styling to create an attractive and functional user interface. This includes defining colors, borders, backgrounds, and layouts using flexbox for alignment.

3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - **Adding Todos**: Users can add new tasks by typing into an input field and pressing Enter or clicking an "Add" button.
   - **Editing Todos**: Supports inline editing of task names directly within the list item. Changes are saved when the user clicks outside the editable area.
   - **Marking as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed using checkboxes. Completed tasks have a strikethrough effect.
   - **Deleting Todos**: Provides a way to delete individual tasks with a delete button (`<i class="fa fa-times"></i>`).
   - **Important/Starred Feature**: Allows users to mark tasks as important by clicking on a star icon (`<i class="fa fa-star"></i>`). Starred tasks appear differently and can be filtered separately.
   - **Filtering**: Supports filtering tasks by status (All, Completed, Incomplete, Important). Active filters are highlighted.
   - **Delete All**: Provides an option to delete all tasks at once using a "Delete All" button.

4. **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is responsive across different screen sizes, utilizing media queries and flexible layouts.

5. **LocalStorage**: Uses `localStorage` to persist user data (todos) across page reloads, ensuring tasks are saved locally in the browser.

6. **User Experience**: Enhances usability with hover effects, transitions, and interactive elements like checkboxes and buttons.

This todo list application aims to provide a seamless user experience with essential task management functionalities. If you have specific aspects or features you'd like to explore or need help with, feel free to ask for further assistance!
